# Education Workspace Migration Instructions

## ✅ Fixed Migration Ready to Run

The migration has been fixed to properly reference `public.profiles` and `public.stores` to match your existing schema.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**

2. **Copy the Migration**
   - Open `/migrations/add_education_workspace.sql`
   - Copy the **entire content**

3. **Run in SQL Editor**
   - Paste into a new query
   - Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`

4. **Verify Success**
   - You should see: "Education workspace migration completed successfully!"
   - No errors

## 📊 What This Migration Does

### Tables Created:
- ✅ `students` - Student roster (like staff, but for education)
- ✅ `class_sessions` - Weekly recurring class times (like shift_templates)
- ✅ `attendance_records` - Student attendance tracking
- ✅ `student_notes` - Teacher observations

### Tables Modified:
- ✅ `stores` - Added `workspace_type` field ('business' or 'education')
- ✅ `stores` - Added education fields (subject, grade_level, room_number, academic_year)
- ✅ `stores` - Made latitude/longitude nullable (not required for classrooms)

### Security:
- ✅ All RLS policies configured
- ✅ Teachers can only access their own classes
- ✅ Students can only view their own data
- ✅ Complete data isolation between workspaces

## 🧪 After Running - Test Steps

1. **Refresh your app** (if running locally)

2. **Create a test education workspace:**
   - Go to `/owner/create-store`
   - Click "Giáo Dục" (Education)
   - Fill in:
     - Class Name: "Math 101 - Grade 10A"
     - Subject: "Mathematics"
     - Grade Level: "Grade 10"
     - Room: "204"
     - Academic Year: "2024-2025"
   - Click "Tạo Lớp Học"

3. **Verify in dashboard:**
   - You should see the new class card with:
     - 🎓 icon
     - Green border
     - "Giáo Dục" badge
     - Subject, grade level, room info
     - "0 học sinh"

## ❌ If You Get Errors

**"relation already exists"** - Safe to ignore, means some tables were already created

**"column already exists"** - Safe to ignore, migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS`

**Other errors** - Let me know and I'll help debug!

## 📝 What's Next After Migration

Once migration succeeds, we can:
1. Create conditional tab navigation (Today/Timetable/Students/Settings)
2. Build Teacher Today tab (roll call interface)
3. Build Teacher Timetable tab (session management)
4. Build Teacher Students tab (roster management)
5. Create API routes for education features

Ready to continue after you run this! 🚀
